=head1 Summary

This is pretty clearly an emulation of the Seaside tutorial.  Except the
overhead for seaside is a bit bigger than this...  I'd say. There is no smoke
or mirrors here, just the raw code. We even implement our own 'prompt'...

This is meant to be as minimal (yet almost useful) example as possible, serving
as a very simple tutorial of the basic functionality.

  # This keeps track of the number we're currently on

  # After we're done with that we enter a loop. Forever.
