=head1 Summary

This is pretty clearly an emulation of the Seaside tutorial.  Except the
overhead for seaside is a bit bigger than this...  I'd say. There is no smoke
or mirrors here, just the raw code. We even implement our own 'prompt'...

This is meant to be as minimal (yet almost useful) example as possible, serving
as a very simple tutorial of the basic functionality.

my $server = Continuity->new;
$server->loop;

# Ask a question and keep asking until they answer. General purpose prompt.
sub prompt {
  my ($request, $msg, @ops) = @_;
  $request->print("$msg<br>");
  foreach my $option (@ops) {
    $request->print('<a href="?option='.uri_escape($option)."\">$option</a>&nbsp;");

  # Subtle! Halt, wait for next request, and grab the 'option' param
  my $option = $request->next->param('option');
  return $option || prompt($request, $msg, @ops);

# Main is invoked when we get a new session
sub main {
  # We are given a handle to get new requests
